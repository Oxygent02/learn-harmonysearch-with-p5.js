# learn-harmonysearch-with-p5.js
This project is an UI that sketch the harmony search algoritm based on javascript.
I use this for learning how harmony search is working.

There are the parameters:

x1 , x2       //the input values
f(x1,x2)      //the evaluation function
targetIterasi //maximum effort for doing the algoritm
targetTrial   //maximum effort for doing the algoritm while the new Aesthethic value equal the current maximum Aesthethic value
hmcr          //Harmony Memory Consideration Rate
par           //Pitch Adjustment Rate
xup,xlow      //Limitations of x(inputs)

Thanks for Mr.shiffman (https://github.com/shiffman) for inspiring me how to code with p5.js
