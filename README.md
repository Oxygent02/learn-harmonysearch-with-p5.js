# learn-harmonysearch-with-p5.js
This project is an UI that sketch the harmony search algoritm based on javascript.<br />
I use this for learning how harmony search is working.
<br /><br />
There are the parameters:
<br /><br />
x1 , x2       //the input values <br />
f(x1,x2)      //the evaluation function <br />
targetIterasi //maximum effort for doing the algoritm <br />
targetTrial   //maximum effort for doing the algoritm while the new Aesthethic value equal the current maximum Aesthethic value <br />
hmcr          //Harmony Memory Consideration Rate <br />
par           //Pitch Adjustment Rate <br />
xup,xlow      //Limitations of x(inputs)
<br />
Thanks for Mr.shiffman (https://github.com/shiffman) for inspiring me how to code with p5.js
